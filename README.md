# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, designed and built to showcase selected projects, case studies, and my approach to design.  
The site focuses on clarity, restraint, and usability — presenting work without unnecessary decoration.

## ✨ Purpose

- Present selected design projects and case studies
- Communicate my design thinking and process
- Provide a clear way to contact me or view my work elsewhere

## 🎨 Design Principles

- Minimal, content-first layout  
- Strong typography and clear hierarchy  
- High contrast and accessibility-aware color choices  
- Responsive design across desktop and mobile  

The goal is to let the work speak, not the interface.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3 / Bootstrap  
- JavaScript (where needed)  

*(Adjust this section if you use a framework like React, Vue, etc.)*

## 📱 Responsiveness

The site is fully responsive and optimized for:
- Desktop
- Tablet
- Mobile devices

Layouts adapt using a mobile-first approach.
